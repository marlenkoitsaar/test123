        <h2>Ursus maritimus (Polar bear)</h2>
        <p>
          Polar bears are the largest carnivorous land mammals on Earth. They
          are about seven to eight feet long, measured from the nose to the tip
          of their very short tail. Male polar bears are much larger than the
          females. A large male can weigh more than 1,700 pounds, while a large
          female is about half that size (up to 1,000 pounds). Bears can weigh
          about 50 percent more after a successful hunting season than they do
          at the start of the next; most of this additional weight is
          accumulated fat. A newborn polar bear weighs only about 1.5 pounds.
